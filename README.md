Our study showed that CLP-A, CLP-E and CLP-P enhanced osteogenesis and ALP activity in MC3T3-E1 cells without causing cytotoxicity, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents for osteoporosis. Cyberpharmacology further highlights their involvement in key signaling pathways, such as the PI3K-Akt and Ras signaling pathways, which are critical in bone metabolism and osteoporosis, however, further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. This database contains data from studies on the therapeutic effects of cyclolinopeptides on osteoporosis: network pharmacological analyses such as target prediction, PPI network, and pathway enrichment data (Additional file 1-7); and data from in vitro experiments such as toxicity assays on MC3T3 cells and Raw 264.7 cells, ARS and ALP staining (Additional file 8-11)
