Mutations in more than one gene locus can be involved alone or in combination in the production of the HNPCC phenotype (also called Lynch syndrome). Most families with clinically recognized HNPCC have mutations in either MLH1 or MSH2 genes. HNPCC is an autosomal, dominantly inherited disease associated with marked increase in cancer susceptibility. It is characterized by a familial predisposition to early onset colorectal carcinoma (CRC) and extra-colonic cancers of the gastrointestinal, urological and female reproductive tracts. HNPCC is reported to be the most common form of inherited colorectal cancer in the Western world, and accounts for 15% of all colon cancers. Cancers in HNPCC originate within benign neoplastic polyps termed adenomas. Clinically, HNPCC is often divided into two subgroups. Type I: hereditary predisposition to colorectal cancer, a young age of onset, and carcinoma observed in the proximal colon. Type II: patients have an increased risk for cancers in certain tissues such as the uterus, ovary, breast, stomach, small intestine, skin, and larynx in addition to the colon. Diagnosis of classical HNPCC is based on the Amsterdam criteria: 3 or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer, one a first degree relative of the other two; 2 or more generation affected; 1 or more colorectal cancers presenting before 50 years of age; exclusion of hereditary polyposis syndromes. The term suspected HNPCC or incomplete HNPCC can be used to describe families who do not or only partially fulfill the Amsterdam criteria, but in whom a genetic basis for colon cancer is strongly suspected. HNPCC6 is a type of colorectal cancer complying with the clinical criteria of HNPCC, except that the onset of cancer was beyond 50 years of age in all cases.;Defects in TGFBR2 are a cause of esophageal cancer [MIM:133239].;Defects in TGFBR2 are the cause of Loeys-Dietz syndrome type 1B (LDS1B) [MIM:610168].

Other microorganisms rarely cause severe clinical disease in individuals with susceptibility to mycobacterial infections, with the exception of Salmonella which infects less than 50% of these individuals. The pathogenic mechanism underlying MSMD is the impairment of interferon-gamma mediated immunity whose severity determines the clinical outcome.

MODY [MIM:606391] is a form of diabetes mellitus characterized by autosomal dominant transmission and early age of onset. Mutations in GCK result in mild chronic hyperglycemia due to reduced pancreatic beta cell responsiveness to glucose, decreased net accumulation of hepatic glycogen and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis following meals.;Defects in GCK are the cause of familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia type 3 (HHF3) [MIM:602485].
